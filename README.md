# Java Practice

## Description
This repository contains various Java programs demonstrating different concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and other basic Java functionalities, stay tuned for more updates.

## Structure
- `Java/`: The root directory of the Java files indicating my first Java Program i.e. `Hello World`.

[//]: # (- `Java/src/com/javaPreReq/conditionalsAndloops`: This package contains a Java program that demonstrates the use of conditionals and loops in Java and some basic questions.)

[//]: # (- `Java/src/com/OOPs_Basic/Function_Method`: This package contains a Java Function/Method program.)

[//]: # (- `Java/src/com/OOPs_Basic/Abstraction.java`: Placeholder for demonstrating abstraction in Java.)

[//]: # (- `Java/src/com/OOPs_Basic/DiamondProblems.java`: Placeholder for demonstrating the diamond problem in Java.)

## Getting Started
